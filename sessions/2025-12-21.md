# Session Notes - December 21, 2025

## Issue Resolved
Screen brightness dip/flicker that was occurring every second.

## Root Cause
**USB power budget on PC** - The issue was hardware/power related, not a software problem.

The display dipping was caused by insufficient power delivery from the PC's USB port, likely due to:
- USB hub power limitations
- Multiple devices sharing the same USB controller
- Momentary current spikes during WiFi/display activity exceeding available power

## Solution
Use a powered USB hub or connect directly to a high-power USB port.

## Previous Investigation (Dec 20)
The following code optimizations were attempted but were not the cause:
- Added text comparison in `clock_update_task()` to prevent unnecessary label updates
- Temporarily disabled clock task for testing

These changes can be reverted or kept as they are still good optimizations.

## Analog Clock Status
Continued work on analog clock implementation:
- All 12 hour labels displaying correctly
- Labels and tick marks properly aligned
- 3 needles configured (hour, minute, second)
- **Pending**: Hand position calibration (rotation_offset needs adjustment)

## Files Modified
- None (hardware issue)

## Notes
- When debugging display issues, always consider power delivery first
- ESP32 + display + WiFi can draw significant current during peak activity
