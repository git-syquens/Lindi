- Tick marks aligned with hour positions
- Hour, minute, and second hands showing accurate time
- 330° arc with acceptable gap between 1-2 o'clock

See [documentation/analog_clock.md](../documentation/analog_clock.md) for implementation details.

- Implemented by Claude AI assistant
- Expected to work, pending verification
