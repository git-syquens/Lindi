## Status Update

### Analog Clock - COMPLETED ✅
All previously identified issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Item #1: Hour marks aligned with labels
- ✅ Item #2: "12" label displaying correctly (not "0")
- ✅ Item #3: All 12 labels visible
- ✅ Item #4: Labels positioned at correct clock positions (12 at top)
- ✅ Item #5: Hand positions now accurate for current time

The analog clock is now fully functional with:
- Proper dial orientation (12 at top, 0°)
- All 12 hour labels correctly displayed
- Tick marks aligned with hour positions
- Hour, minute, and second hands showing accurate time
- 330° arc with acceptable gap between 1-2 o'clock

See [documentation/analog_clock.md](../documentation/analog_clock.md) for implementation details.

## New Feature: Color Picker

### Accent Color Customization
Added color picker widget for customizing UI accent color.
- Implemented by Claude AI assistant
- Expected to work, pending verification
- If issues arise, will be debugged in future session

## Notes
- User attempted Claude plugin directly but found it less suitable for ESP-IDF projects
- GitHub Copilot in VS Code remains primary development assistant for this project

## Resolution - Hardware Issues, Not Code! 

### The Real Problem
After extensive debugging, discovered **dual hardware failures**:
1. **Dev board**: Loose VCC connection to MPU6050
2. **Reference board**: Loose SCL connector

Both failures coincidentally occurred simultaneously, leading to false assumption of software issues.

### Additional Optimization
**Removed \i2c_scan()\ debug code** from \mpu6050_init()\:
- Added on Dec 24th (commit e24959d) for debugging WHO_AM_I issue
- Caused 4+ second boot delay (scanning 127 I2C addresses)
- Now removed for production use

### v1.0 Release - STABLE 
All features working correctly:
-  Analog clock with correct orientation
-  MPU6050 sensor (supports 0x68 and 0x70 WHO_AM_I values)
-  Color picker for UI accent customization
-  Fast boot time (no unnecessary I2C scanning)
-  Both hardware boards operational after connector repairs
